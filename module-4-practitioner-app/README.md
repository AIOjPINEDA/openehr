# Module 4: Building a Practitioner-Facing App

This module focuses on building a more advanced application for healthcare practitioners to capture complex clinical assessments using the template created in Module 3.

## Assignment Specification

1. Build a functional user interface for the template that you built in Module 3
2. Your app should be able to create new compositions
3. Your app should be able to list existing compositions
4. Use the shared openEHR server!

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to handle complex compositions in a web application
- Understand how to create user-friendly interfaces for complex clinical forms
- Implement data validation for clinical data
- Build functionality for editing existing clinical data

## Key Concepts to Master

### Complex Composition Handling

- Creating complex compositions from scratch
- Handling nested structures and repeatable elements
- Managing terminology bindings
- Validating complex data structures

### Advanced UI Design for Clinical Applications

- Designing intuitive interfaces for complex forms
- Implementing progressive disclosure patterns
- Creating context-sensitive help and guidance
- Supporting clinical workflows

### Data Management

- Retrieving and displaying existing compositions
- Implementing edit functionality for compositions
- Versioning and audit trails
- Handling data validation errors

## Project: Practitioner Assessment Application

I'll build a web application that allows healthcare practitioners to:

1. Complete the complex assessment form modeled in Module 3
2. View previously completed assessments
3. Edit existing assessments
4. Validate data entry according to template constraints

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: EHRbase openEHR server
- **API Communication**: Fetch API or Axios
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up a new React project with Vite
2. Create components for the complex form sections
3. Implement composition builder service
4. Create views for listing and editing assessments
5. Implement validation and error handling
6. Add styling and user experience enhancements

## Notes and Progress

I'll document my learning journey and progress here as I work through this module.

### Day 1: Planning the Application

(I'll add my notes here)

### Day 2: Building the Form Components

(I'll add my notes here)

### Day 3: Implementing Data Retrieval and Storage

(I'll add my notes here)

### Day 4: Adding Edit Functionality

## Questions and Challenges

I'll track any questions or challenges I encounter here for future reference.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, I'll move on to [Module 5: Building a Dashboard](../module-5-dashboard/README.md) where I'll create a dashboard that visualizes data from multiple templates.
