### Development Tools

- **Git**: Basic knowledge of version control

- **Command Line**: Basic command line operations
  - Navigating directories
  - Running commands
  - Resources: [Command Line Crash Course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

## Healthcare Domain Knowledge

While not strictly required, some familiarity with the following concepts is helpful:

- Basic understanding of electronic health records (EHRs)
- Familiarity with clinical data concepts (e.g., observations, medications, diagnoses)
- Awareness of healthcare interoperability standards (e.g., FHIR, HL7)

## Required Software

The following software should be installed before beginning the bootcamp:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 11 or higher
- **Node.js** - Latest LTS version
- **Git** - Latest version
- **Postman** - Latest version
- **Docker** (optional but recommended) - For running EHRbase

Detailed installation instructions for these tools are provided in the [Environment Setup](environment_setup.md) document.

## Optional Background Reading

- [OpenEHR Architecture Overview](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/architecture_overview.html)
- [Two-Level Modeling and Archetypes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5402275/)
- [Introduction to FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html)

## Self-Assessment

If you're unsure about your readiness for the bootcamp, consider:

1. Can you create a simple web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
2. Can you make HTTP requests to an API using tools like Postman or fetch in JavaScript?
3. Do you understand basic object-oriented programming concepts?

If you answered "no" to any of these questions, consider reviewing the recommended resources before starting the bootcamp.
