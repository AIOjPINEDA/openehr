# .env.example - Environment Variables Template for OpenEHR Bootcamp
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file serves as a template for configuring environment variables needed by the OpenEHR Bootcamp applications.
# Environment variables allow you to store configuration settings outside your code, making your applications more
# secure and flexible.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named '.env' in the same directory:
#    cp .env.example .env
# 2. Edit the .env file to set your specific configuration values
# 3. The .env file should NEVER be committed to version control (it's already in .gitignore)
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# The .env file will contain sensitive information like passwords and API keys.
# Keep it private and never share it or commit it to public repositories.
