# Documentation Standards for OpenEHR Bootcamp

Write all documentation in English.
Include README.md per module with setup and learning objectives.

Record architecture decisions in `/docs/` directory.

For Mermaid diagrams, enclose node labels with special characters in double quotes.
Avoid starting node text with patterns like `1. Text` that Mermaid might misinterpret.
Use default Mermaid theme colors for better compatibility.
Ensure high contrast between text and background colors.

Document API usage examples in Postman collection format.
Track progress in module-specific markdown files.
Reference bootcamp repository examples when available.
Link to official OpenEHR specifications for technical concepts.

Use feature-based documentation structure within modules.
Co-locate documentation with code when possible.
Version control documentation files to track changes.
